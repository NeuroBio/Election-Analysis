# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
Tom and Seth of the Colorado Board of Elections are interested in automating the analysis of vote tallies.  I was asked to write a python script to analyse the results of the last election as a proof of concept.  This script should output the following:
- The number of votes cast
- The number of and percentage of votes cast in each county
- The county that cast the most votes
- Number of votes recieved by each candidate and the percentage of the total vote earned
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
 
## Resources
* Data Source: [election_results.csv](Resources/election_results.csv)
* Software: Python 3.6.7, VSCode 1.43.2

## Results
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
   - Total Votes: 369,711
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
   - Jefferson: 38,855 votes (10.5%)
   - Denver: 306,055 votes (82.8%)
   - Arapahoe: 24,801 votes (6.7%)
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
    - Denver
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
   - Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 votes (23.0%)
   - Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes (73.8%)
   - Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes (3.1%)
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
   - Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes (73.8%)
