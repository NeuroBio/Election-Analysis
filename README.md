# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
Tom and Seth of the Colorado Board of Elections are interested in automating the analysis of vote tallies.  I was asked to write a python script to analyse the results of the last election as a proof of concept.  This script should output the following:
- The number of votes cast
- Number of votes recieved by each candidate and the percentage of the total vote earned
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
 
## Resources
* Data Source: enection_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.6.7, VSCode 1.43.2
